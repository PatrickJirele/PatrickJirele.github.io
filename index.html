        Hello! My name is Patrick Jirele and I graduated from Western Colorado University in May 2024. 
        I received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and an emphasis in Scientific Computing. 
        My software engineering career started at Arcitecta,
        a software company on a mission to build the world's best data management platforms. It was at this 
        company that I got my foot in the door with my internship. Since then I have strived to continue this work
        to better the world with technology. 
        I am excited about the world of A.I. and the many great things it can bring us. I have some personal projects 
        implementing neural networks in DJI Tello drones to detect objects it was trained on.
        My core skills are programming, mathematics, and data analytics. My preferred languages in code are Python, GoLang, and C++. 
        I like data science and analytics a lot due to my passion for math and probability and my work on my senior project demonstrates my ability
        to integrate both of my interests very well. 
        Outside of programming, my other hobbies include running, hiking, and spending time with friends. I like giving back to the community as I have volunteered with marathon aid stations
        as well as coached local running clubs for all ages. 
        Feel free to reach out to me at pjjirele@gmail.com! I'd love to hear from you!
