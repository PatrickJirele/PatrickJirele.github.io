        <p>
          Hello! My name is Patrick Jirele and I graduated from Western Colorado University in May 2024. 
          I received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with an emphasis in Scientific Computing. 
          My software engineering career started at Arcitecta,
          a software company on a mission to build the world's best data management platforms. It was at this 
          company that I got my foot in the door with my internship. Since then, I have strived to continue this work
          to better the world with technology. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am excited about the world of A.I. and the many great things it can bring us. I have some personal projects 
          implementing neural networks in DJI Tello drones to detect objects they were trained on.
          My core skills are programming, mathematics, and data analytics. My preferred languages are Python, GoLang, and C++. 
          I like data science and analytics a lot due to my passion for math and probability, and my senior project demonstrates my ability
          to integrate both of my interests very well. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of programming, my other hobbies include running, hiking, and spending time with friends. I like giving back to the community as I have volunteered with marathon aid stations
          as well as coached local running clubs for all ages. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:pjjirele@gmail.com">pjjirele@gmail.com</a>! I'd love to hear from you!

              The Human Analytics Web-App is a comprehensive diversity dashboard developed for the Division of Inclusivity at Western Colorado University. This tool displays diversity statistics, graphs, and analytics for faculty and staff, enabling the Division to manage and publicly share their data. The app allows administrators to upload datasets, create visualizations, and customize the dashboard, ensuring the data is accessible and interactive. Key features include data analysis and visualization capabilities, a functional webpage, and exclusive data management rights for the Division. Optional enhancements include custom search filters, temporal data organization, and additional admin account creation.

            <p class="project-description">
              This project utilizes a DJI Tello drone equipped with TensorFlow Lite to autonomously locate and identify tennis balls using real-time image processing. The application, designed in Python, combines drone flight control with advanced machine learning techniques to recognize objects within the camera's field of view. The main objective of this project is to enable the DJI Tello drone to autonomously detect tennis balls in a predefined area using a TensorFlow Lite model. The project incorporates Python scripts for controlling the drone's movement and handling image recognition tasks.
